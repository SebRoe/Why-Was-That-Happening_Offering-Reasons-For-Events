#### Readme for the Causal Hans Examples 

This directory is dedicated to the Causal Hans Examples. We have adopted an SCE, T-SCE and a T-SCE example with 2 Contexts. Using the Python Notebook as a playground, one can try the different methods once the appropriate data has been generated.

The subdirectories SCE, TSCE, DynTSCE are constructed to apply to various causal examples through the instantiation of the classes located within (CausalHansSCE.py, CausalHansTSCE.py, CausalHansDynTSCE). The execution files are augmented by (0_DistributionGenerator.ipynb, 3_DistributionGeneratorDynTSCE.ipynb) for generating distributions based on a causal graph concept. Note that these distributions still need to be generated. Furthermore, within these files, the parameters of the approximated causal graph can be modified - the InterpreterXXX class will then overwrite the existing causal model.

**Requirements:** The Python installation can be completed with the commands ``python -m venv env`` and ``pip install -r requirements.txt``. Running the Python notebooks generates two new subfolders: tmp_data, tmp_img. Explanation Trees are stored in tmp_img. We use the [Anytree](https://anytree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library for creating Explanation Tree images and [Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) for exporting them. If no images are desired, the corresponding lines can simply be commented out.
